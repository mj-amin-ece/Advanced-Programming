### Assignment 1
- **Focus:** Gradient Descent and Model Training  
- **Description:**  
  This assignment focuses on implementing a gradient descent algorithm to train a predictive model. The tasks include:
  - Implementing the `train` function to minimize the cost function iteratively using a learning rate.
  - Displaying the output of the trained model, showing the actual and predicted grades of students.
  - Writing functions to save and load the weights used for prediction.
  - Creating a `predict` function to estimate a student's grade based on input features.

### Assignment 2
- **Focus:** Matrix Operations and Linear Algebra  
- **Description:**  
  In this assignment, you will implement a **Matrix** class and provide various linear algebra operations. Key tasks include:
  - Implementing functions for matrix operations like determinant, inverse, transpose, and column deletion.
  - Working with CSV files to load and save matrices.
  - Solving the matrix chain multiplication problem using dynamic programming.

### Assignment 3
- **Focus:** Neural Networks and Model Evaluation  
- **Description:**  
  This assignment involves building and training a neural network. You will implement the neural network class, train the model on datasets, and evaluate the performance of the network. Tasks include comparing multiple networks and finding the optimal one for classification.

### Assignment 4
- **Focus:** Custom Data Structures (Doubly Circular Linked Lists)  
- **Description:**  
  The focus here is on implementing a priority doubly circular linked list for managing student objects. The list allows operations such as searching, sorting, and maintaining student scores for homework, exams, and projects.

### Assignment 5
- **Focus:** Midterm Retake and Enhancement  
- **Description:**  
  This assignment allows students to retake the midterm exam with modifications. It is aimed at enhancing students' understanding of previously covered material and improving their exam scores.


---

### Assignment 6
- **Focus:** Object-Oriented Design for Storehouse Management  
- **Description:**  
  This assignment focuses on designing a storehouse management system using object-oriented programming. You will create classes for different goods (e.g., food, appliances) and manage customer assets, along with implementing features such as iterators, smart pointers, and function pointers.


---

### Assignment 7
- **Focus:** Face Recognition with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
- **Description:**  
  This assignment involves building a face recognition system using the eigenfaces method. Tasks include:
  - Preprocessing face images using the `loadImage` function.
  - Applying PCA for dimensionality reduction and generating eigenfaces.
  - Implementing k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) for classifying new faces based on Euclidean distances.


---

### Assignment 8
- **Focus:** Functional Programming and Python Decorators  
- **Description:**  
  This assignment introduces functional programming concepts in Python. You will implement custom decorators such as `timeit`, `noexcept`, and `static_vars`, and complete additional exercises to deepen your understanding of functional programming.
