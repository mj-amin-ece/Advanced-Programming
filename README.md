### Assignment 1
- **Focus:** Gradient Descent and Model Training  
- **Description:**  
  This assignment focuses on implementing a gradient descent algorithm to train a predictive model. The tasks include:
  - Implementing the `train` function to minimize the cost function iteratively using a learning rate.
  - Displaying the output of the trained model, showing the actual and predicted grades of students.
  - Writing functions to save and load the weights used for prediction.
  - Creating a `predict` function to estimate a student's grade based on input features.

### Assignment 2
- **Focus:** Matrix Operations and Linear Algebra  
- **Description:**  
  In this assignment, you will implement a **Matrix** class and provide various linear algebra operations. Key tasks include:
  - Implementing functions for matrix operations like determinant, inverse, transpose, and column deletion.
  - Working with CSV files to load and save matrices.
  - Solving the matrix chain multiplication problem using dynamic programming.

### Assignment 3
- **Focus:** Neural Networks and Result Management  
- **Description:**  
  This assignment involves building a neural network class and managing results. Key tasks include:
  - Training multiple networks with varying hidden layers and comparing their performance.
  - Using CSV files to load datasets and evaluate the trained models.
  - Displaying comparisons between predicted and actual values.


---

### Assignment 4
- **Focus:** Doubly Circular Linked Lists and Custom Data Structures  
- **Description:**  
  This assignment focuses on implementing a **Priority Doubly Circular Linked List** to manage student data. Tasks include:
  - Creating a list that stores students' homework, midterm, and project grades.
  - Implementing search, display, and dynamic modification of the list.
  - Prioritizing students based on calculated values.

### Assignment 5
- **Focus:** Midterm Retake and Improvement  
- **Description:**  
  This assignment allows students to retake the midterm exam with slight modifications. Students who wish to improve their grades must complete the exam and submit their work by the specified deadline.

### Assignment 6
- **Focus:** Storehouse Management System with Object-Oriented Design  
- **Description:**  
  This assignment involves designing a storehouse management system using object-oriented programming. Key tasks include:
  - Creating a hierarchy of goods (BasicGoods, Food, Material, Appliance).
  - Managing customer assets in the storehouse.
  - Implementing advanced object-oriented features like constructors, destructors, and preventing object copying.

### Assignment 7
- **Focus:** Face Recognition using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
- **Description:**  
  This assignment involves building a face recognition system using the eigenfaces method, which applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to a dataset of faces. The key tasks include:
  - Implementing the `loadImage` function to load and preprocess face images.
  - Using PCA to reduce dimensionality and extract the most relevant eigenfaces.
  - Implementing a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm to classify new faces based on the nearest eigenfaces.

---

### Assignment 8
- **Focus:** Functional Programming and Python Decorators  
- **Description:**  
  This assignment introduces advanced Python features such as functional programming and decorators. The tasks include:
  - Writing one-liner functions without loops or list comprehensions using `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.
  - Implementing Python decorators like `timeit` to measure execution time, `noexcept` to catch and handle exceptions, and `static_vars` to add static variables to functions.
